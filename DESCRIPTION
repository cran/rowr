Description: Rowr allows the manipulation of R objects as if they were
    organized rows in a way that is familiar to people used to working with
    databases.  It allows more consistent and predictable output to common
    functions, and generalizes a number of utility functions to to be failsafe
    with any number and type of input objects.
