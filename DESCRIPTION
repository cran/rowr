Description: Provides utilities which interact with all R objects as
    if they were arranged in rows.  It allows more consistent and predictable 
    output to common functions, and generalizes a number of utility functions to
    to be failsafe with any number and type of input objects.
Depends: R (>= 3.0.1)
